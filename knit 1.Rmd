## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:
## First I will load the packages
```{r }
library(here)
library(OpenStreetMap)
library(tidyverse)
library(sf)
library(rgdal)
library(magrittr)
library(janitor)
```
#Reading in the Data 
```{r}
poi_east_sussex <- st_read(here::here("east-sussex-latest-free.shp",
                           "gis_osm_pois_a_free_1.shp")) %>%
  st_transform(., 27700) %>%
  #select hotels only
  filter(fclass == 'pub')
## looking at the data in excel, the first row are headers, NAs are blank, lat and long are in seperate columns (thank god). However there are no dates- interesting
crime_data_october <- read_csv(here::here("25f9fd74a80cc61fcb55a1c231061cd39528c7ca",
                                         "2021-10",
                                         "2021-10-sussex-street.csv"),
                       na = c("", " ", "NA", "n/a")) %>%
  clean_names()

LSOA <- st_read(here::here("Lower_Super_Output_Area_(LSOA)_IMD2019__(WGS84)-shp",                        "5878ebcf-f091-4bde-8864-aa547dd45afd2020330-1-8g4usn.8evuq.shp")) %>%
  st_transform(., 27700)

```
```{r Make spatial object}

```
